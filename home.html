      <p><span class="hl-yellow">Electry is pitched as “LinkedIn for skilled blue-collar workers.”</span></p>
      <p>We <span class="hl-yellow">iteratively designed Electry's web interface</span>, beginning with low-fi designs and culminating in user testing.</p>
      <p>We chose Electry, because we liked the idea of exploring a familiar problem — finding employment — in a different industry — blue-collar work.</p>

    <h2>Low-Fi Designs</h2>
    <p>
      Essentially, <span class="hl-yellow">Electry is a job board to connect blue-collar workers with companies looking to hire</span> them.
      Companies publish job openings on the platform, workers to find opportunities that match their qualifications
      and preferences, then the companies can follow-up with applicants off-platform.

  <section id="User Testing" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" class="grey">
    <h4>Part 3</h4>
    <h2>User Testing</h2>

    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>We asked users to complete the onboarding process and share their profile with an employer that matched their preferences. Specifically, our instructions were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scenario: You are a trained blue-collar worker looking for a job. </li>
      <li>Subtask 1: Sign up by completing the onboarding process. Be sure to answer every question in the survey.</li>
      <li>Subtask 2: Now that you have gotten a list of employers that match your preferences, explore your recommended jobs and share your profile with one employer</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Post-Test Questions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Were you successful at completing the task? How difficult was it?</li>
      <li>What frustrated you most about this site?</li>
      <li>If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?</li>
      <li>What did you like about the site?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>User Videos</h3>

    <div class="gr1 gc2 flex-col">
      <video class="wf-img" controls>
        <source src="./videos/Video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.

      <span class="grid-caption">User Testing Video </span>

        <source src="./videos/Video2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <span class="grid-caption">User Testing Video 2</span>

    <div class="gr1 gc2 flex-col">

        <source src="./videos/Video3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <span class="grid-caption mb-4">User Testing Video 3</span>
    </div>

      

    <h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
      <p> Based on the Tasks + Subtasks, the UserTesting results show that users were generally able to complete the tasks without any issues.  The results reveal that users enjoyed how the interface was simple to use, concise and effectively indicated progress with visual cues. </p>
      <h3>Expectations </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Completing Profile + Sharing Profile Task: Since this was an assigned task, we expected that the users would be able to complete their profile successfully, which all the users did. </li>
        <li>Navigated to My Jobs Page: This was not in the assigned task, however we expected that users would navigate to the My Jobs page, at least to confirm that their job application went through. All the users checked the “My Jobs” page once they completed the tasks. </li>
        <li>Editing Profile: We expected that users would attempt to edit their profile. However, only User 3 went back to edit their profile. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Overall, user behaviour was mostly in line with expectation. Users completed tasks successfully and navigated to the “My Jobs” page.  However, not all users went back to edit their profile as we expected them to. </p>

    <h3>Errors</h3>
    <p>Users couldn’t always figure out how to navigate away from the “My Jobs” page. User 3 was particularly confused by the ambiguity of which page clocking on the logo would take them to. </p>

    <h3>Future changes based on results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>On the “My Jobs” page, add a go back button to navigate back to recommended jobs (As user 3 suggested)</li>
      <li>When editing profiling, allow users to click between profile sections (As user 3 suggested)</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="Takeaways" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>Overall, we learned a lot from this project. Being able to get feedback from a formal critique and from user testing
      was extremely important and helped us create a mockup that we are proud of. </p>
